== About ==

GoSQLite3 provides both low-level and high-level wrappers for accessing the SQLite3 database from Go.
It started as simple wrapper around the sqlite C API which has since been extended with a number of 
high-level conveniences.


== Installation ==

We support installation via the go tool which can be invoked using the following command-line:

	go get github.com/kuroneko/gosqlite3


== Usage ==

Please read the tests for examples of how to perform queries and handle results.
Documentation will follow in due course.
